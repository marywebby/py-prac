## python journey! 🐍 
this repo will be a collection of things I have leanred from each chapter of Python Crash Course [find here!](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280) + a little journal of thoughts and feelings 

## chap 1 + 2 + 3 🫣
starting off strong with strings, lists, and data types
- living for the symplicity of everything, i accidently find myself copying javascript syntax and having to dumb it down but in a more efficent way
- i found my favorite parts were whenever i get to write `message = (f"my favorite singer is {singer.title()}.")`, cause i just love watching my stuff be imputted into the message. 

## chap 4 part 1➿
transition into loops!!!
- in javascript, this was one of my favorite and helpful methods to do a lot of things at once
- so much simpler than js, no having to worry about random curly brackets out of place, although i have found it tricky to be like "hey, how does py know how to do that there??"
- anyway, 7/10 for day 4, eating it up

## chap 4 part 2🍰
finished out 4 
- finished out chapter 5!
- learned about slicing and creating tuples
- PEP 8 and common styling convention, converting tabs to 4 spaces
- can see a lot of stuff in this chap used for leaderboards in games 
- on to the next!!!!🚀

## chap 5 !!
1 chap in 1 day!
- allllll about conditional statements 
- really interesting to learn about all the different ways to add if/elif/else and when not to include if or else or elif
- really started imagining using these different if statments in projects i want to do further down the road
- busted out one whole chapter in one day and feeling very on top of it!

## chap 6 📘
dictionaries!!
- began chap 6 and feeling like review with js objects
- first few pages FLEW by, really getting the hand at the basic python syntax and being able to easily read examples
