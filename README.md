## python journey! 🐍 
this repo will be a collection of things I have leanred from each chapter + a little journal of thoughts and feelings 

## chap 1 + 2 + 3 🫣
starting off strong with strings, lists, and data types
- living for the symplicity of everything, i accidently find myself copying javascript syntax and having to dumb it down but in a more efficent way
- i found my favorite parts were whenever i get to write `message = (f"my favorite singer is {singer.title()}.")`, cause i just love watching my stuff be imputted into the message. 

## chap 4 part 1➿
transition into loops!!!
- in javascript, this was one of my favorite and helpful methods to do a lot of things at once
- so much simpler than js, no having to worry about random curly brackets out of place, although i have found it tricky to be like "hey, how does py know how to do that there??"
- anyway, 7/10 for day 4, eating it up

## chap 4 part 2🍰
finished out 4 
- finished out chapter 5!
- learned about slicing and creating tuples
- PEP 8 and common styling convention, converting tabs to 4 spaces
- can see a lot of stuff in this chap used for leaderboards in games 
- on to the next!!!!🚀
