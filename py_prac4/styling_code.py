# notes on styling code 
    # styling conventions

    # the syle guide 
        # making changes to python, when someone wants to chnage python code they write a PEP
        # PEP = pythong enchanment proposal. 
        # one of the oldest PEP is PEP 8, which instructs python programmers on how to style their code
        # PEP 8 is fairly lenghtly, relates to complex coding structures than whats been seen so far. 
        # python coders will always tell you to write code that is easier to read than code that is easier to write
    
    # indentation 
        # PEP 8 also tells us to use 4 spaces per individual level
        # this imporves readibility 
        # python interpreter gets confused between tabs and spaces. 
            # each text editor provides a setting that lets you use the tab key but then converts each tab to a set number of spaces
            # tab key can be used, but make sure the settting are changed. 
    
    # line length
        # many programmers say that each line should be less than 80 characters 
            # standard was developed because most computers could only read 79 characters per line
        # limit all comments to 72 characters 

    # blank lines
        # grouping parts of your program visually add blank lines
        # adding a blank line between sections is appropriate, however do not add 3-4 lines between sections
